# KiranaMart-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
---
## Overview:

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive, end-to-end dashboard for KiranMart’s sales report. It involves data transformation, data modeling, creation of key performance measures, and creation of an interactive dashboard to answer critical business questions. The goal is to present sales data in a visually clear and insightful manner that facilitates strategic decision-making.
The dataset contains sales data of KiranaMart from 2020 to 2023. We will use this dataset to answer some questions, which will facilitate strategic decision-making.								

Key Objectives:

- __Sales Metrics Analysis:__ The dashboard will track and visualize key performance indicators, including total Sales, Profit, and the percentage of Returned Orders. Additionally, it will provide a comparison of these metrics with the previous year’s data, highlighting percentage changes to identify trends and performance shifts.

- __Year-over-Year Sales Performance Comparison:__ A time-based analysis will be implemented to compare sales performance against the previous year. This feature will allow the identification of growth or decline patterns over specific periods, enabling a more informed understanding of seasonal and market-driven trends.

- __Profitability Insights:__ The dashboard will pinpoint the most profitable product and the least profitable (or loss-making) product. This insight will support inventory management, pricing strategy, and sales focus.

- __Profit Location Analysis:__ By examining geographic data, the dashboard will identify the region or location generating the highest profit. This analysis will help in understanding market dynamics and regional performance, assisting with targeted marketing or sales strategies.

- __Sales Performance by Segment:__ The dashboard will provide an in-depth breakdown of sales by customer segment, highlighting variations in performance across different customer groups. This will allow the business to tailor its approach to each segment, optimizing product offerings, promotions, and customer engagement strategies.
